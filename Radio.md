### Radio as Wireless Sound

#### Brief History and Technical Details

Radio is basically an electronic device that receives the emitted radio waves from radio station, and converts it to audible sound. There is a controversy about who invented the radio, but its patent belongs to Italian invertor G. Marconi (1896). On the other hand, the invention can be regarded as a collective invention since there were too many scientists and engineers working on wireless communication at that time.

Radio involves a wide range of audio and musical media, from commercial, public to pirate broadcasting. Invention of the *wireless sound* has opened up new horizons. By 1920s wireless sound was understood as both a military necessity and commercial opportunity.

In Turkey, first radio broadcasting began in 1927 after one or two years which radio broadcasting started in the world. By 1949, there were two radio transmitters in Turkey. ITÜ and Istanbul radio station begun to broadcasting in 1946 and 1949 respectively.[ [1] ](http://iletisim.ieu.edu.tr/flows/?p=1143)

Türkiye'de ilk radyo yayını, Eşref Şefik'in bu anonsu ile bundan tam 85 yıl önce 6 Mayıs 1927'de başladı. 6 Mayıs 1927'de Sirkeci Büyük Postane'de 5 kilowatlık verici ile yapılan ilk radyo yayını, henüz kimsede radyo bulunmadığından ötürü her aksam posta binasının kapısının üzerine yerleştirilen hoparlör aracılığıyla duyruluyordu.

## Radio's Social Historicity

Radio itself is a spatial metaphor. It indexes the cultural imagination of a broadcast signal that gathers its audience through waves of sound.

An important example:

"The voice of fighting Algeria" 

Algeria was a dominion country of France for 130 years. The radio program had an important role in the formations of anarchist politics and Algerian anticolonial nationalists and therefore the independency of the country.

Cezayir Bağımsızlık Savaşı, Cezayirli Müslüman Araplar ile Avrupalı Cezayirlilerin arasındaki sürtüşmenin, 130 yıllık Fransız koloni yönetimine karşı bir isyana dönüşmesiyle başladı.

### Some Reports and Thoughts on Radio

According to study of Dougles (2004), for some listeners:

- Radio evoked claustrophobia with the sense of presence of unimaginable numbers of people being always and everywhere.

- On the contrary, just like the "walkman effect", some people reported they felt isolated in crowd.

According to Kitler, radio itself receded to limits of awareness. Remote things became "ready-to-hand" with wireless sound/information and this leads to complexity and expansiveness. I interpreted this as just like internet provides everything, not only information, but disinformation and distraction.

According to Collins (2009), radio waves assisted to investigation of the world's hidden magnetic music. While "radio" generally works by acquiring intentionally transmitted electromagnetic (EM) signals, there are also unintentionally generated EM frequencies, for instance lightning, sunspots, galactic sounds, crosstalk between systems, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), etc.

#### Brief Note on CMB

CMB is electromagnetic radiation left over from an early stage of the universe and also the most important evidence of hot Big Bang model of the universe.
