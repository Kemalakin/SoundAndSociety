### Brief History and Technical Details

Radio is basically an electronic device that receives the emitted radio waves from radio station, and converts it to audible sound. There is a controversy about who invented the radio, but its patent belongs to Italian invertor G. Marconi (1896). On the other hand, the invention can be regarded as a collective invention since there were too many scientists and engineers working on wireless communication at that time.

Radio involves a wide range of audio and musical media, from commercial, public to pirate broadcasting. Invention of the *wireless sound* has opened up new horizons. By 1920s wireless sound was understood as both a military necessity and commercial opportunity.
