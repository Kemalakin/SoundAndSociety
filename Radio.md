### Brief History and Technical Details

James Clerk Maxwell (1831 – 1879) His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as different manifestations of the same phenomenon. Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics"

With the publication of "A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field" in 1865, Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light. Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena. The unification of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.

There is a controversy about who invented the radio, but its patent belongs to Italian invertor G. Marconi (1896). 

In Turkey, first radio broadcasting began in 1927 after one or two years which radio broadcasting started in the world. [1](http://iletisim.ieu.edu.tr/flows/?p=1143)
